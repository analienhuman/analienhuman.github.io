            <h1 class="sub-heading">The Human Role in Evolution</h1>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, humans are distinct from other living beings due to their free will and intellectual capabilities. Their ultimate purpose is not just to survive but to accomplish evolution tasks—tasks that push civilization forward and help future generations evolve.
                <br>
                <br>
                Earth exists in an ordered system, where natural laws maintain stability. However, humans are not bound to a pre-determined path. They live in a world filled with events, which can be classified into:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Normal Events – Regular life occurrences that do not significantly impact evolution.</li>
                    <li>Evolution Events – Crucial moments or discoveries that direct humanity toward evolutionary progress.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                For Earth to remain in order, these evolution events must happen. However, because humans have free will, they can choose whether or not to act on them.
                <br>
                <br>
                When individuals reduce their thoughts and concentrate on a single purpose, they begin to align with the natural flow of Earth. This alignment increases the chances of encountering evolution events. If they act on them, they contribute to human progress. This could be why people say:
                <br>
                "If you work hard, the universe will help you."
                <br>
                Perhaps, what they are really experiencing is their own thoughts aligning with an evolution task, directing them toward fulfilling it.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">The Origin of the Concept of God</h1>
            <p>
                The concept of God likely emerged when early humans feared natural events they could not explain. In every society, the most powerful, wise, or influential individual naturally became a leader, and over time, these leaders were worshiped as gods.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, the actual gods of religious texts never wrote any books—their followers did. These followers interpreted their wisdom, forming religions around their teachings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thus, I think a possible definition of "God" could be:
                <br>
                "A person who understood nature and the cosmos better than anyone else in their community."
                <br>
                <br>
                People misunderstand the concept of God. From my perspective, God is not a person or an entity that watches over humans, punishes or saves them, or determines their fate in heaven or hell. If that were the case, how would prayers work? Many people believe they achieve things through prayer, but is there a deeper explanation behind this?

            </p>
            <!--  -->

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Why Do Prayers Seem to Work?</h1>
            <p>
                Many believe that when they pray intensely, their prayers are answered. But perhaps the real mechanism is this:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>When people pray intensely, they focus on a single thought.</li>
                    <li>Reducing thoughts aligns them with the natural flow of Earth.</li>
                    <li>If what they pray for is related to their evolution task, they naturally get directed toward accomplishing it.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                This makes them believe that God answered their prayers, when in reality, it was their own focused alignment with an evolution event that led them to success.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">The Role of Religion in Evolution</h1>
            <p>
                Religions, I believe are a set of rules for living, often promising heaven for obedience and hell for disobedience. However, the paradox is that people follow these rules without ever having seen God themselves.
                <br>
                <br>
                While religions may have originally helped maintain social order, over time, they have also slowed down evolution by discouraging critical thinking and unquestioned obedience to tradition.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Final Thoughts</h1>
            <p>
                The purpose of life is not just survival but also:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Living in a way that aligns with personal and societal well-being (e.g., laws, ethics).</li>
                    <li>Exploring nature and seeking answers to fundamental "why" questions.</li>
                    <li>Contributing or assisting in evolutionary tasks that drive humanity’s progress.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                These evolutionary tasks include advancements in science, technology, philosophy, and society. Each generation has the responsibility to contribute or support those who contribute to these tasks, ensuring that future generations continue to evolve physically, intellectually, technologically, and socially. Belief in God or adherence to religion is not a necessity for existence. Instead, we should live as human beings who seek knowledge from nature, question the world around us, thereby understand the nature and universe and evolve to higher levels, sustaining the progression of the universe.
