            <h1 class="main-heading">The Origins of the Universe: A New Hypothetical Perspective</h1>
            <p>
                If someone asks, "What was there before the Big Bang?" there is no definite answer. So, I started thinking about it, could something have existed before that? In my previous post, I shared a thought experiment regarding numbers. If you haven't read it yet, you can check it out
                <a href="/posts/post-1.html">here</a>
                .
                <br>
                <br>
                I believe that numbers represent the fundamental language of the universe. Applying this perspective, I propose a new way to think about the origin of the universe.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">A New Perspective on the Universe’s Origin</h1>
            <p>
                Consider a vast space of complete darkness filled with quantum energy (say "i") (which can be equated with vacuum energy). This energy fluctuates and due to these fluctuations, some energy points begin to expand, forming regions in space filled with negative energy (say -1), which I call negative energy packets. As the energy packets expand, the negative energy inside them transforms into negative mass. Over time, the negative mass accumulates, and its growth reaches a point, where accumulation of mass happens exponentially. This exponential growth eventually leads to the contraction of the mass, resulting in the formation of a dense negative mass energy point called a singularity.
                <br>
                <br>
                The singularity expands, and during this expansion, the dense negative mass formed gets transformed into positive energy forms (say +1), which are distributed throughout the expanding negative energy packet. This transformation represents the observable universe. The negative mass energy within the packet is called the Dark realm, and the positive mass energy within the packet is called the Observable realm. Together, the Dark and Observable realms form the universe. In simpler terms, the expanding negative energy packet can be referred to as the universe.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">The Role of Gravitons in the Dark Realm</h1>
            <p>
                According to the Big Bang theory, gravitons are said to have formed after the Big Bang. But, in this hypothesis, gravitons must have formed before the expansion of the singularity.
                <br>
                <br>
                Why?
                <br>
                <br>
                When negative energy gets converted into negative mass, collisions between negative mass particles must have happened. These collisions would have caused the emission of negative energy particles.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this case, the emitted particles might be gravitons, but they belong to the Dark Realm.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since we exist in the Observable Realm, our physics is likely based only on this realm, hence we do not have direct access to the Dark Realm gravitons. However, we can still experience their effect—gravity itself.
                <br>
                <br>
                So, in this hypothesis:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gravitons exist as products of the Dark Realm.</li>
                    <li>They cannot be observed directly because they belong to a hidden framework of reality.</li>
                    <li>However, their effects manifest in the Observable Realm, which is why we experience gravity but cannot detect gravitons as individual particles.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading">The Interaction Between Observable realm and the Dark Realm</h1>
            <p>
                Keeping these things in mind, I went through another thought experiment i.e., Once positive mass emerges, it may not simply exist in isolation. Instead, it could create a positive energy field that increases as it becomes denser. But here's where it gets interesting: positive mass-energy field might not exist in a static state. It could influence the surrounding dark realm, i.e., the dark realm pushes towards the positive mass.
                <br>
                <br>
                I think this interaction between positive energy forms and dark realm might be at the core of space-time curvature. Perhaps the mass of objects deforms space-time not only due to their own gravitational pull, but also because of the interaction between positive and negative energy. As the positive mass-energy increases, it could deform the space-time fabric, potentially creating the curvature that we perceive as gravity.

            <h1 class="sub-heading">Final Thoughts</h1>
            <p>
                This is purely a speculative hypothesis, intended to inspire new ways of thinking about cosmology. Since negative energy and mass are not yet fully understood, I aim to explore this idea further—possibly developing a mathematical framework to support or challenge it.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the next post, I will discuss the order of the universe within this perspective.
